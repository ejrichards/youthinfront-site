How Schools Prevent Walkouts
=================

Realize that schools and districts donâ€™t always want you to walk out. They may suggest alternate approaches and may employ other tactics to discourage walkouts. [This is what Los Angeles Unified suggested in 2008](https://rems.ed.gov/docs/ll_vol3issue1.pdf): 
* Create an educational component around issues of concern.
* Give students an alternate forum for political expression.
* Persuade students it is not in their best interests to conduct a walkout.
* Schedule an intervening event to distract or dissuade students from walking out.
