How to meet with a decision-maker
=================================

### Before the meeting:
- Plan carefully.
- Be clear about your goal.
- Prepare your argument and be clear about what your 'ask' is.
- Practice what you'll say (and try to keep it short).
- If relevant, research the decision-maker so you know something about him/her.

### During the meeting:
- Be on time.
- Introduce yourself: Shake hands, make eye contact, explain who you are and who you represent (such as your age group, community, school).
- Make a persuasive argument and make your 'ask.'
- Listen carefully, respond respectfully to questions.
- Ask for a commitment. Write down their response. 
- Remember to thank them at the end of the meeting.

### After the meeting
- Write down or record your notes from the meeting as soon as possible (while your memory is fresh).
- Send a thank-you email.  If relevant, re-state any commitments or plans that were agreed on in the meeting.
- Plan your next steps.
