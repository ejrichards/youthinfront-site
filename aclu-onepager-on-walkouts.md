Advice on Student Walkouts from the American Civil Liberties Union
=================

- Missing school to participate in a political protest must be treated the same as an unexcused absence. Punishment cannot be more severe and students have the same right to make up missed work. 

- Generally, students may not be suspended for participating in a walkout. Sanctions less severe than suspension are supposed to be used for first-time offenders and for absenteeism. 

- Under Washington State's [Becca Bill truancy provision](http://www.k12.wa.us/GATE/Truancy/), parents must be notified in case of one unexcused absence. A student must have unexcused absences in a month before a truancy petition is led in court against the student or parents or both. 

- Schools cannot lock exits to prevent a walkout. This is a serious threat to the health and safety of students and staff. Contact the district superintendent’s office if this happens.

- Check school district’s written rules around speech regulations to check if plans are permissible. 

- Schools are allowed to adopt reasonable rules which regulate the “time, place, and manner” of exercising free speech. For example, they can prevent the distribution of flyers during class time but not during lunch. 

- Schools cannot censor speech unless what is being said falls under the following exceptions:					
  - it is foreseeable that the speech will cause substantial disruption of the operation of the school;					
  - it is too lewd or vulgar for the school audience.
