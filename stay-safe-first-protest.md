So it's your first protest?
===========================
## A Guide to Staying Safe at Public Protests and Demonstrations
Brought to you by [My Civic Workout](https://www.mycivicworkout.com/)

### Before you go
- Dress like you’re going to an outdoor sports game or concert.

- Wear sturdy, closed-toe shoes and bring enough layers.

- Charge your phone.

- Keep everything lightweight. To make signs easier to hold, mount them on cardboard paper towel

- Plan to go with a group if possible, and swap phone numbers with all your group members (or set up a group text). Have a plan for when and where you will meet back up after the protest, in case you get separated during the march itself.

### At the protest
- When you’re protesting in a public space, like in the streets or outside a federal building, you can take photos and videos of anything in plain view. Everyone’s behavior helps to set the tone for the protest.

- Show your respect for the people around you by not littering and by keeping chants positive.

- The vast majority of protests are planned to be peaceful, and you can expect them to stay that way. Just use common sense and trust your instincts. If you see someone yelling and stirring up the protestors or police, or you have a gut feeling that something is not right, alert your group and make a group decision as to whether or not to leave together.
