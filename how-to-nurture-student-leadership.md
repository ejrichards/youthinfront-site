How to Nurture Student Leadership
=================

Elicit opinions and ideas from young people, and allow those ideas to systemically influence practices and policies in a school:

* Ask young people directly what they need and want in order to feel safe and nurtured in school.
* Empower a group of youth researchers â€” send them out regularly to investigate issues relevant to students and school climate.
* Integrate young people into school leadership teams that are looking at questions of safety and belonging.
* Partner with existing community-based organizations that are doing violence-prevention work and who have young people already engaged in it.
