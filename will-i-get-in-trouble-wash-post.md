Will I Get in Trouble?: Washington Post
=================

Click [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/21/a-texas-school-superintendent-threatens-to-suspend-students-protesting-gun-laws-but-thats-not-legal/?utm_term=.f41d05342e04) to read the Washington Post piece on the legality of threatening suspensions.

Texas and Virginia superintendents threaten protesting students with suspension. This is declared unlawful: “It’s a quintessential First Amendment violation, and most Americans have an instinct about that,” Heidi Li Feldman, a professor at Georgetown Law, said in an interview. “What’s really weird about this is that they announced they will suspend people over the content of their off-campus protest. Content-based restrictions on speech are anathema to the First Amendment. So this looks like a total problem.”
