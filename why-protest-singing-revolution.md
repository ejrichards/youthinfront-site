Singing Revolution
=================

>"The young people, without any political party, and without any politicians, just came together. Not tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands… to gather and to sing and to give this nation a new spirit.” 

-Mart Laar, Estonian activist

The nation of Estonia had been under the violent Soviet rule for several decades. The Singing Revolution was a peaceful, non-violent revolution for freedom that began in 1988 and resulted in the nation’s freedom in 1991. The participants were common people who banded together for a common cause—freedom. Every day, hundreds of thousands of protestors gathered and sang forbidden songs of patriotism. There were no political elites leading the movement—it was just music and song that helped a peaceful nation overthrow its despotic rulers.
