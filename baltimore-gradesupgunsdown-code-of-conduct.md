Create a Code of Conduct for your Action
=================

On March 6, students at schools across Baltimore marched to city hall. This was their code of conduct:

* Only walk on the sidewalks
* If police tell you to do something, do not resist; be respectful
* Organizers are not responsible for anything you do
* Do not destroy property
* Do not be violent towards people or property
* Think about the image we want to portray (i.e. keep in mind it is a **peaceful** protest)
