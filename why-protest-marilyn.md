>"...I was 8 years old at that time…and I suggested, made a motion that we would go down to Katz Drugstore and just sit, just sit and sit until they served us.”

-8-year-old Marilyn’s suggestion led to the drugstore desegregating its lunch counter in 1958, followed by several other restaurants in Oklahoma City. Watch her talk about it [here](https://www.loc.gov/item/afc2010039_crhp0012/).
