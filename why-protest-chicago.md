Chicago Public Schools Boycott, 1963
=================

On October 22, 1963, 250,000 students in Chicago (about half the students in the city) staged a one-day boycott of their classes to protest racist housing codes and school boundaries. About 20,000 marched to the Chicago Board of Education. After the protest, the Chicago Public Schools was forced to share a racial headcount of schools demonstrating that the system was still segregated almost 10 years after the Brown v Board of Education ruling (which had declared racial segregation unconstitutional). The boycott also led to a series of larger protests around the country against systemic racism and inequity.
